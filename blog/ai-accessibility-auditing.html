                <h2>Turn accessibility audits into actionable design requirements in minutes, not hours.</h2>
                <p></p>
                <p><strong>A11y Audit Pro (Experimental Release)</strong> represents the culmination of years of UX analysis, research, and accessibility reporting experience. Built to solve the real pain points I've encountered as a designer working across accessibility projects, this tool demonstrates how strategic design thinking can be amplified through AI-powered automation.</p>

                <p>As a UX designer, you know accessibility matters—but WCAG compliance can feel overwhelming. Manual audits are time-intensive, technical jargon is hard to translate into design requirements, and stakeholders need business-focused explanations, not technical reports.</p>

                <p>This represents exactly the kind of AI-accelerated workflow that's transforming how designers work. Just as we discussed with wireframes becoming obsolete when "more real things" are possible at the same speed, accessibility auditing is evolving from manual checklists to intelligent, automated analysis with actionable outputs.</p>

                <h2>What A11y Audit Pro Does for UX Designers</h2>

                <p><strong>A11y Audit Pro</strong> transforms accessibility auditing from a technical burden into a strategic design tool by combining real accessibility scanning with AI-powered requirement generation—demonstrating the "design when the power goes out" philosophy applied to accessibility expertise.</p>

                <h3><strong>Real Accessibility Analysis</strong></h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Scan any public URL (prototypes, staging sites, live products)</li>
                    <li>Uses axe-core—the industry standard for accessibility testing</li>
                    <li>Identifies actual violations with specific element references</li>
                    <li>Evaluates WCAG A, AA, and AAA compliance levels</li>
                </ul>

                <h3><strong>AI-Generated Product Requirements</strong></h3>
                <p>This is where the tool shines for UX designers. <strong>Claude AI</strong> analyzes your specific accessibility findings and generates comprehensive PRD sections:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Functional Requirements</strong>: User-facing features needed to address accessibility gaps</li>
                    <li><strong>Technical Requirements</strong>: Implementation specs for developers</li>
                    <li><strong>Testing Requirements</strong>: QA protocols for ongoing accessibility</li>
                    <li><strong>Compliance Requirements</strong>: Legal and standards compliance measures</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Each requirement includes clear statements, business value explanations, implementation guidance, and priority levels based on user impact.</p>

                <h3><strong>Designer-Friendly Outputs</strong></h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Executive summaries with business-focused recommendations</li>
                    <li>WCAG compliance scores across all levels</li>
                    <li>Detailed triage plans with timeline estimates</li>
                    <li>Rich text export for seamless integration into design documents</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>How UX Designers Can Use This Tool</h2>

                <h3><strong>1. Early Prototype Validation</strong></h3>
                <p>Test Figma prototypes or staging environments before development begins. Generate accessibility requirements that can be integrated directly into your design system.</p>

                <h3><strong>2. Stakeholder Communication</strong></h3>
                <p>AI-generated executive summaries help you communicate accessibility value to non-technical stakeholders with concrete data and clear timelines—delivering those "convincing deliverables that require less cognitive load" we discussed.</p>

                <h3><strong>3. Developer Handoff</strong></h3>
                <p>Export detailed technical requirements directly into Jira, Confluence, or Linear. Provide specific element references and implementation guidance that developers can act on immediately.</p>

                <h3><strong>4. Design System Enhancement</strong></h3>
                <p>Use audit findings to identify common accessibility patterns that need systematization and create reusable accessibility guidelines for your team.</p>

                <h2>Built with Claude Code: A Real-World AI Development Story</h2>

                <p>What makes this tool particularly interesting is how it was created—entirely using <strong>Claude Code</strong> on my Mac through the terminal, leveraging my Claude Pro subscription. This represents a perfect example of the AI-accelerated workflows we've been discussing.</p>

                <p>Using natural language prompts and iterative refinement with Claude Code, I was able to build a complete accessibility auditing solution without traditional development overhead. The entire process—from concept to working application—demonstrated how strategic thinking combined with AI execution can rapidly produce professional-grade tools.</p>

                <p>The result? A comprehensive accessibility reporting tool that costs approximately <strong>$0.01 per report/analysis</strong> to operate, making professional-grade accessibility auditing accessible to individual designers and small teams.</p>

                <h2>The AI-Powered Workflow</h2>

                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Input</strong>: Enter any publicly accessible URL</li>
                    <li><strong>Analysis</strong>: Real accessibility scanning identifies violations</li>
                    <li><strong>AI Processing</strong>: Claude analyzes findings and generates tailored requirements</li>
                    <li><strong>Output</strong>: Comprehensive PRD sections ready for your workflow</li>
                    <li><strong>Export</strong>: Copy formatted requirements into your existing tools</li>
                </ol>

                <p>This represents the kind of strategic thinking + AI execution workflow that defines the future of design practice. AI handles the technical analysis and documentation generation, while human judgment guides the strategic application and quality assessment.</p>
